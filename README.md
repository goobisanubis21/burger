# Overview

The burger app is a user friendly web application that allows a user to create their own burgers. User can type the name of their burger into the input field and when clicking on the submit button the burger will be added to the mysql database. It will then refresh the page so that the burger will be added to the list of burgers below. User will then have the option to devour a burger which will then, updating the database, move the devoured burger over to the devoured section. Once in the devoured section the user will have the option to delete the burger which will completely drop it from the database and no longer be viewed on the page. This application uses the mysql package along with the express package.
